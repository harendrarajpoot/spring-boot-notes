	}

@RequestMapping

@RequestMapping Annotation We can use with both Method level and class level.

This is a more general-purpose annotation that can be used to map methods to HTTP requests, specifying the HTTP method as a parameter.
Syntax:- @ReqeustMapping(value=”/url”,method=Request.GET)
Example:-
@RequestMapping(value="/hi",method=RequestMethod.GET)
	
	public String hiHarendra()
	{
